Java is a multi-threaded language. This means that multiple threads run in parallel to complete
program execution. If you are trying to execute a multi-threaded environment this is where 
synchronization of objects takes place. The objects that are shared among multiple threads must 
be synchronized in order to avoid unexpected behavior or any corruption. With this being said the synchronized run is more 
reliable and has improved performance.
